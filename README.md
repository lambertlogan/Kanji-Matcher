Kanji Matcher:

The objective of Kanji Matcher is to be a simple website where one can practice their Japanese
knowledge by matching Kanji to its respective Hiragana reading and to serve as a community for
fellow Japanese learners. Currently only aiming to include N5-level Kanji but may expand in the
future.
